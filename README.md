### Info

Repo for my article about writing [chat app in Akka](https://dzone.com/articles/writing-a-chat-with-akka).


### Running

To run I recommend importing this project to IDE and running it from there it should work out of thr box.

If you want to change the port, check the `chat-app.conf` file.
